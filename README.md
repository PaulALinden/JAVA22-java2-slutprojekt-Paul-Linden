#Producer-Consumer 

Simpel producer-consumer project with MVC-structure.
Contains handling of threads & singelton pattern.

My solution was to keep the project as simpel as possible and to apply single responsibility principle.
- Model is responsible for managing the data and business logic.
- View is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
- Controller is responsible for handling user actions and coordinating the interaction between the Model and the View.
